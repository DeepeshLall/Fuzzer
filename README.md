# Fuzzer

This contains a self made library in c++ from the motive of fuzzing and exploaration of software vulnerability. The fuzzing has been done using the prebuilt Tools for testing such as AFL and LibFuzzer.

# Exposure

We followed the step.txt guide file to run AFL and test over the different test case. For more details refer : steps.txt

We also have updated the final outcome of our analysis and progress in progress.txt.

# Steps

Steps and the commands we ran over the repo for final time and exposure run through are mentioned in commands.txt. With different testcase mentioned in test1.txt.

# File-System fuzzing:

There's also a step ahead in our learning experience by applying our takeaways over a subset of filesystem like structure. The details of this are mentioned in folder file system fuzzing.
